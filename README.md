# Exploring the Rosetta Stone of Human Capital

This project was based on the working paper [A Rosetta Stone of Human Capital](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/rosetta-stone-human-capital), by Dev Patel and Justin Sandefur. Also, the related article at [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/10/03/its-better-to-be-a-poor-pupil-in-a-rich-country-than-the-reverse) was taken into consideration. <br />

This project has been written with Python for the needs of the cource "Business Analytics Practicum I" offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics of the Athens University of Economics and Business.
